# Tic Tac Toe Game using JavaFX - Client/Server

## Overview


This repository contains the implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game developed as a Java project during the Android Mobile Applications Development track at the Intensive Code Camp program held in ITI - Smart Village.

The Tic Tac Toe game features a client/server architecture built using JavaFX. It offers users the opportunity to play against a computer opponent with two distinct difficulty levels or engage in online multiplayer matches with other players on the same network.

The client application, constructed using JavaFX, provides an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for an immersive gaming experience. On the other hand, the server application utilizes sockets and JSON for efficient network communication, facilitating seamless interaction between players during multiplayer sessions.

To ensure effective data management, the application leverages Apache Derby as a reliable database management system.

This project serves as a demonstration of skills acquired in Java programming, network communication, user interface development, and database management. It offers an entertaining and interactive game while showcasing the practical implementation of fundamental concepts and technologies in the domain of Java application development.
